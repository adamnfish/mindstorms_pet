= PET =

A pet for our house!

== Behaviour ==

Currently, Pet will explore the room when you press the touch sensor (avoiding obstacles) and sing to itself every now and then. While idle, Pet will be startled 
by loud noises.

== Sounds ==

Includes a sounds file with some useful functionality. Not least, play_sounds(int notes[], int duration) that emulates polyphony by rapidly changing the pitch 
between a provided array of notes. (8-bit style)

== Requirements ==

For use with Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0.

You'll need to bulid a suitable robot. I'll add details at some point.
